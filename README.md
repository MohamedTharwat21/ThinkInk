## Project Overview

**Electroencephalography-to-Text (EEG-to-Text) generation** is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. This groundbreaking technology focuses on transforming brain activity, captured through EEG signals, directly into natural text. It represents a pivotal innovation in Brain-Computer Interfaces **(BCIs)**, opening doors to novel applications that enhance communication, accessibility, and productivity for individuals worldwide.

**EEG-to-Text technology** offers a life-changing solution for individuals who cannot speak or write due to conditions like ALS, paralysis, or severe motor impairments. **By decoding their thoughts into text** , this project provides a pathway for communication and interaction, restoring independence and quality of life.
